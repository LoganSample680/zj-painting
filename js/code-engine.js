// ── The code engine ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Owner directive 2026-09-07: the code books drive the estimate, behind the
// scenes, correctly. He never opens a calculator. He builds an estimate, this
// runs on what is already on it, and the required lines appear in the same
// card the history suggestions use, at his prices, one tap.
//
// THREE RULES, and they are the whole design.
//
// 1. FACTS AND PROCEDURES, NEVER DOCUMENTS. See codes/README.md. Every dataset
//    under codes/ is values and rules in OUR schema, typed out of a purchased
//    book. No code text, no layout, no scans. A citation is a reference and is
//    fine; a paragraph is not.
//
// 2. NOTHING UNVERIFIED EVER REACHES A RESULT. A dataset an LLM drafted is
//    plausible and wrong, and a wrong ampacity on a permit is the worst thing
//    this product could ship. `verified:false` returns no answer at all. A
//    human holding the edition flips it, by name, on a date.
//
// 3. PURE, LIKE THE DERIVER. Same inputs, same answer, always, no clock, no
//    network, no globals (see js/geo-derive.js, which earned this rule the
//    hard way). That is what makes it testable against the code's own
//    published worked examples, which is how we prove correctness rather than
//    assert it.
//
// The result object carries five things, and it carries them together on
// purpose: the answer, what went in, which edition, every default the engine
// filled in, and the citation. That one object is the audit trail, the
// disclaimer, and what prints on the proposal. Anything that returns a bare
// number is wrong.

// Loaded datasets, keyed 'family:edition'. Registered at boot, never mutated.

// Which edition this account is on for a family. He confirms it once, because
// he knows what his inspector enforces and no public dataset does: the only
// vendor holding local amendments (UpCodes) does not sell an API, and every
// other source is state-level. Asking beats pretending.
