// THE DAY DERIVER. One pure function that turns the phone's raw record of a
// day (the CoreMotion tape and the GPS fixes) into the day's time rows and
// mileage legs. It is the only thing allowed to decide what a drive or a
// dwell IS.
//
// Owner spec, 2026-09-02, verbatim where it matters:
//
//   "core motion should mint one id that then follows the journey, when core
//    motion flips id is minted, right away that fires a gps ping that looks up
//    location, find the address and how its saved in the system and applies
//    it correctly to the time log (shop, lead, client address, supply house,
//    etc) then starts real time GPS for the mileage writer if address we grab
//    start time and look for the complete trip of addresses in a data base
//    the next time we have a core motion flip back to walking"
//
//   "we only save automatic logged drive time to time log when we go from one
//    saved address to another saved address inside of tradedesk"
//
//   "closes drive legs with a personal stop into them to do the direct route
//    to the next geo fence you arrive at that day"
//
//   "This rule should also have the ability to clean up mileage and time logs
//    based on core motions iOS tape on boot."
//
// WHY A PURE FUNCTION. Three weeks of the previous design (three observers
// each writing rows for the same event, ~20 sweeps reconciling them, a reader
// correcting the result) never converged because nothing anywhere stated what
// the rows were supposed to be. This file states it. Live tracking calls it
// as each flip lands; boot calls it over the tape's whole seven-day window and
// REPLACES every automatic row for those days with the output. Same input,
// same output, same ids, every time: a rebuild is idempotent by construction
// and a force-quit costs nothing, because the tape is still on the phone.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never reads globals, never touches the DOM, never
// writes anywhere. It does not know about manual clocks: the clock is an
// INPUT to the reader's blend (js/timelog.js _tlBlendManual), never something
// a rebuild can touch. It does not route: a collapsed leg carries the straight
// line and says so, and an enrichment step can upgrade it to a routed figure
// on the same id without creating a row.
//
// THE RULE, in the order the day happens:
//
//   1. A foot -> automotive transition on the tape is a JOURNEY START. Its id
//      is minted right there, from who and when, so the same flip always
//      mints the same id.
//   2. The fix nearest that flip is looked up: which saved fence contains it.
//      That fence labels the dwell that just ENDED (the departure ping "sees
//      the geofence you're in").
//   3. An automotive -> foot transition is the JOURNEY END. Its fix is looked
//      up the same way.
//   4. Both ends saved and different: a LEG is written (traced-path miles,
//      wheels-turning minutes) and a dwell opens at the destination.
//   5. Destination not saved: the journey is PENDING. Nothing is written. The
//      next journey continues the chain under the FIRST journey's id.
//   5b. A gap between two automotive segments is a STOP only if the phone can
//      be shown to have stayed put across it: the gap is stillEndMs or longer,
//      or the fixes bracketing it are within a fence radius of each other.
//      Otherwise it was one drive and the classifier was wrong.
//   6. A pending chain that later reaches a saved fence collapses to ONE leg:
//      first saved origin to this fence, direct-route miles, drive minutes =
//      the automotive segments only (a stop is not drive time).
//   7. Same fence both ends is a round trip: NO MILEAGE, ever. If a stop
//      happened between them, the drive time rows are still written and the
//      hole between them is an unsaved job site (owner 2026-09-04). A
//      same-fence loop with no stop in it writes nothing at all.
//   8. A chain still pending at the end of the day writes nothing. The manual
//      clock covers it, and the blend already shows that remainder as Manual
//      time.
//   9. A dwell exists only between an arrival and a departure. The first
//      stretch of the day (before any drive) and the last (after the final
//      drive) are not automatic rows: home is not work, and if it was, the
//      clock says so.
//  10. EXCEPT PAPERWORK (owner 2026-09-02: "if it's a home office, app time
//      still counts", "yes, count it on no-drive days", and then the edge:
//      "office throws in after the fact for true app time after hours,
//      that's it; never office time unless it's outside of business hours
//      and we're home actively with the app open"). Inside a home-office
//      fence, minutes with the app OPEN are an Office row ONLY outside the
//      working day: before the first drive, after the last real work, or
//      on a day with no drive at all. Inside the working day the house is
//      whatever the dwell says it is (the shop, a home stop), never Office.
//      Carved out of any surrounding home dwell, never laid on top of it,
//      so no minute is counted twice. Presence is proven by fixes inside the
//      fence, never assumed from the app being open somewhere.
//  12. THE TRUCK WAS WHERE THE PHONE SAT (owner 2026-09-02). A departure's
//      origin is the last fix before the automotive flip with no drive on
//      the tape in between, when that fix is inside a fence; the nearest
//      fix inside the window is the fallback. A phone that slept through
//      the flip and woke down the road still names the fence it left.
//      Mirror for arrivals: the first fix after the walking flip and
//      before the next drive, when none sits inside the window.
//  11. THE DAY ENDS WITH THE LAST REAL WORK (owner 2026-08-24, restated
//      2026-09-02 on his own 5:29pm: "those aren't needed"). A dwell at a
//      base (the shop, a home office) that begins after the day's last
//      job, client or supply dwell is not a row, except for a wrap-up
//      allowance at a shop that is NOT also somebody's home: unloading the
//      truck is work, an evening at the house is not. A day with no
//      non-base work at all keeps its base dwells (a crew member's day at
//      the yard is a shift).

// Jack's 3 September, 1:55 to 2:53pm, came out as two back-to-back drives with
// nothing between them. CoreMotion never left automotive in that whole stretch,
// so the journey builder, which ends a journey on a foot or a long still flip,
// had nothing to end on. The fixes knew: he was 66 ft from his dad's shop at
// 2:14 and then the phone said nothing for THIRTY MINUTES. A truck does not go
// quiet for half an hour on the road.
//
// This is the mirror of _gdStayedPut. That uses "the phone is still producing
// fixes in the same spot" to REFUSE a phantom departure; the same evidence
// asserts an arrival here. It works on STILLNESS, and stillness means one
// thing only: the phone is in the same place before and after. Two other
// readings were tried against his real week and both are wrong.
//
// NOT "a fix landed inside a fence". He drives past his own shop: 14 fixes
// landed inside a fence mid-drive in one week across two accounts, one of them
// two seconds before a fix outside it. That rule would have invented 14 stops.
//
// NOT "the phone went quiet". A silence is not evidence of anything, which the
// data says plainly. Of the six gaps of ten minutes or more inside a drive that
// week, five were the phone sitting at one spot and ONE was Jack covering 4.8
// miles at 22 mph with the radio asleep. Below ten minutes it is worse: of 67
// gaps in the five-to-ten minute band, 63 show him MOVING, a median of two
// miles across the gap. A gap is the tracker failing, not the truck stopping,
// and the only way to tell them apart is where he was on the far side of it.
//
// So the test is a CLUSTER: consecutive fixes within a fence radius of each
// other spanning parkedStillMs. That covers the long silence too, because a
// fix, a thirty-minute hole and a fix at the same spot is one cluster, while
// the same hole with the far end four miles away is not. See parkedStillMs in
// GEO_DERIVE_DEFAULTS for why four minutes and not two, five or ten.
// THE PHONE NEVER LEFT ONE SPOT. The first run of fixes inside a window that
// all sit within radiusFt of each other and span at least minMs, as

// ── Rule 13: a client visit the day cannot vouch for is a question ────────
// Owner 2026-09-04: "He does work for me at my address. He does work for his
// mom and her address. They're all family members ... we wouldn't want time
// log showing her personal family visit." And, on the schedule-only version:
// "that's easy for us but not for contractors who forget to put shit on a
// calendar."
//
// A job's address is already a fence only on the days the job is active. A
// client's address was a fence every day of the year, so Sunday dinner at
// Mom's was "On site, 4h". Now a dwell at a client fence counts as work when
// any ONE of these vouches for it, in order:
//   1. something is scheduled there that day (the fence carries scheduled:true)
//   2. a manual clock is running over it (the clock is the bracket)
//   3. it falls inside working hours on a working day (default 6am to 8pm,
//      Monday to Saturday; per company, Settings)
// Anything else is HELD: it stays on the rail as a question, counts toward
// nothing, and the dashboard card asks. "Working" makes it a real row that
// survives every rebuild (fixed_at); "Personal" dismisses it, and that sticks
// too. Nobody has to keep a calendar for the ordinary case; the question only
// fires on the odd-hours visits, which are the family ones. What it still
// cannot know, and no competitor can either: a genuinely personal weekday
// afternoon at a client with nothing scheduled counts.
