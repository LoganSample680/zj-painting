//
// Consent model:
//   1. S.teamTracking is on for the account. Tracking is a condition of the job,
//      which is the OWNER's call to make.
//   2. Crew are TOLD before anything is logged. _geoNoticeSheet states plainly
//      what is captured; their tap records location_ack_at + the notice version
//      and, in that same gesture, opens the OS permission prompt. Nothing is
//      tracked before that.
//      We never write an agreement the person did not make: the old code set
//      location_consent=true at sign-in without ever asking, which is a
//      fabricated record, worse in a dispute than having none.
//   3. Owners tracking their OWN time keep a one-time per-device opt-in
//      (localStorage), since that is a preference, not an employment record.
//   4. location_status/checked_at/device record what the DEVICE reported. That is
//      a heartbeat for Fleet & Team, never a proxy for consent.
// Tracking runs whenever location permission is granted. The 07:00-18:00 window
// was removed (owner call): it silently dropped the miles that matter most, a
// Saturday call-out, a 7pm supply run, a 5:30am start, all logged nothing. The
// crew notice states plainly that location is logged; that is the contract.
//
// Writes:
//   • location_pings   , throttled breadcrumb (lat/lon) for the live crew map
//   • job_time_entries , arrival→departure durations per job (feeds Job Profit)
// All manager-side reads of this data are RLS-gated server-side (has_team_perm).
//
// Every entry point is wrapped so a geolocation/permission hiccup never throws a
// console error (CLAUDE.md console-error policy).

// _geoCloseShopEntry had a 2-minute floor and no ceiling.

// ── The shop clock runs while you are WORKING, not while you are home ───────
// Owner question 2026-08-25: "in shop how do we track time loading truck?"
//
// At a yard, dwell is the honest answer: sitting in the shop office writing
// quotes is work. At a shop that IS the house, dwell cannot tell loading the
// truck from eating breakfast, which is the whole reason the home_office kind
// bills active app time instead. But that rule counts phone-in-hand minutes
// (_geoAppActive), so a man loading a truck for forty minutes with the phone
// in his pocket earns nothing. Neither rule describes the work.
//
// The motion coprocessor does. It has been classifying onFoot/still/driving
// around the clock at no battery cost and keeps about a week of history
// (TdGeoPlugin.motionSince, already read by _mileTapeHadPause for errands).
// Loading a truck is walking: house to truck, truck to shelf, back again.
// Sitting at the kitchen table is still. The chip already separated them.
//
// TWO RULES, and they do all of it:
//   1. Still time BETWEEN two walks is paid, up to a bridge LEARNED from this
//      contractor's own tape (_geoLearnIdleCap). That is a bench cut between
//      two trips to the shelf, and where the bench ends and lunch begins is
//      read off how they actually work rather than picked by us.
//   2. Still time before the first walk and after the last walk is NEVER
//      paid. That is the couch, and it is also the geofence firing late.
//
// Rule 2 is why this matters beyond the loading question: the session now
// ends at the last movement rather than at the fence, so the departure lag
// this app has been chasing stops moving the shop number at all.
//
// Sensor limit, stated plainly: the chip needs a gait to say onFoot, so
// standing at a bench reads as still. Bracketed by walks the cap covers it;
// a long motionless bench session with no walking either side is not seen.
// ── THE BRIDGE IS LEARNED, NOT CHOSEN ────────────────────────────────────────
// Owner, 2026-08-25: "I can't make the call on time, it's all going to differ
// based on every office so need something that fits today."
//
// He is right, and a hardcoded twenty minutes was me guessing on behalf of
// every contractor who will ever use this. A painter loading a van, an
// electrician pulling wire across a shop and a landscaper hooking a trailer
// do not share a number, and nobody should be asked to pick one at signup
// about a rule they cannot see working.
//
// So the number comes from the person's own tape. Inside their shop sessions
// the still-gaps between two walks fall into two obvious populations: the
// short ones are the work (setting a box down, reaching for a fitting) and
// the long ones are the break (went inside, sat down to eat). Real shop days
// leave a wide empty middle between the two, so the split is simply THE
// BIGGEST JUMP in their own sorted numbers. No model, no tuning, and it can
// be explained to a contractor in one sentence.
//
// Guard rails, because payroll: it needs enough gaps to have an opinion, it
// needs to actually see a long one (a morning of nothing but quick load-outs
// says nothing about where lunch begins), the jump has to be a real
// separation rather than a step inside one tight cluster, and the answer is

  //
  // Owner, 2026-08-26: "I want it to go to always and stay that way."
  //
  // Straight answer: iOS will not guarantee that. Always is the user's call and
  // Apple requires a confirmation for it. What it WILL do is grant PROVISIONAL
  // Always, and the BackgroundGeolocation watcher below already asks for
  // exactly that: on iOS, addWatcher with requestPermissions:true calls
  // requestAlwaysAuthorization, so accepting the ordinary "While Using" dialog
  // reports back Always and background delivery works from that moment, with
  // iOS confirming it later once it has seen real background use.
  //
  // The bug was the ORDER. This function used to call getCurrentPosition first
  // and only start tracking inside its SUCCESS callback. On the native shell
  // _geoInstallGeoShim has replaced getCurrentPosition with a plugin read that
  // passes requestPermissions:FALSE, deliberately, so it can never prompt. On a
  // fresh install with nothing granted, that read cannot produce a fix, so it
  // times out, the error path reports 'prompt', and startGeoTracking is NEVER
  // REACHED. No dialog. Ever.
  //
  // That is a dead button, and it is literally what the live account recorded
  // on 08-22: "Dead control, no effect on click: _setupTodoGo('location')|Fix
  // it". The tap did nothing because the only thing that can raise the prompt
  // sat behind a read that was configured never to raise one.
  //
  // So on the shell the ask IS starting the tracker. Nothing is read first. The
  // one-shot Always upgrade is spent by the watcher, which is the single place
  // that should ever spend it, and _geoRefreshNativeAuth reports back what iOS
  // actually decided rather than this inferring anything.

// ── THE DRIVE WINDOW: dense GPS only while a drive is actually happening ────
//
// Owner, 2026-09-01, and this is the architecture, not a paraphrase of it:
// "when core motion fires a automotive event and a gps ping or vice versa that
// should fire the continuous drive tracking, then the 30 minute cron job keeps
// confirming and checking the location, when automotive goes back to cycling or
// walking that fire another ping which shuts off the continuous gps."
//
// THREE PARTS, AND THE FIRST ONE IS THE STRICT ONE.
//
// 1. OPENING IS A CORRELATION OF TWO SIGNALS, IN EITHER ORDER. A CoreMotion
//    automotive transition on its own is NOT enough, and that is deliberate:
//    the coprocessor reads automotive from a ride in somebody else's truck,
//    from a bus, and from a phone jostling on a bench, and a bare flip with no
//    position to go with it is exactly the case that must not burn the radio.
//    A GPS ping on its own is not enough either, since the app takes fixes all
//    day for weather and fences. One of each, within _GEO_DRIVE_PAIR_MS of the
//    other, is a drive.
//
//    Order genuinely does not matter, and both orders are the common case.
//    Motion first: the coprocessor needs roughly a minute of sustained
//    movement before it will call automotive at anything but low confidence,
//    but it still beats a geofence, which cannot fire until a line several
//    hundred feet away has been crossed. Ping first: a significant-change or
//    fence wake often lands while the flip is still being decided.
//
// 2. THE 30-MINUTE CRON IS THE CONFIRMER, and it already exists: the
//    geo-ping-cron workflow -> push-geo-ping -> a silent APNs push -> TdGeo
//    records a push-ping carrying the current fix. No second timer is built
//    here (§7.3). While a window is open, each push-ping asks one question:
//    has this phone actually moved since the last confirmation? Moved means
//    the drive is real, so the window is re-asserted and the plugin's safety
//    cap is pushed out. Not moved means the drive ended without anybody
//    saying so, and the confirmer is what notices.
//
// 3. CLOSING IS A MOTION EVENT, AND CYCLING COUNTS AS ONE. Walking, running,
//    cycling or stationary all shut the continuous GPS off. Cycling is called
//    out because the two other places in this codebase that classify motion do
//    NOT agree about it and cannot both be right here:
//      - ingest-geo (supabase/functions/ingest-geo/index.ts:99) puts cycling in
//        AUTO_KINDS, i.e. vehicular, alongside automotive and driving.
//      - _mileTapeHadPause (js/mileage.js) treats cycling as MOVING ON FOOT,
//        on the observation that CoreMotion reads walking around a truck with a
//        phone in your pocket as cycling.
//    The owner named cycling as a stop condition, and for the radio that is
//    the safe direction to be wrong in either way: if it really is a bicycle
//    there are no business miles to trace, and if it is really a walk around
//    the yard the window had to close anyway. The server's disagreement is
//    NOT changed from here; it decides which legs open, which is a far wider
//    blast radius than the radio, and it is flagged rather than quietly
//    rewritten.
//
// EVERY DECISION IN THIS BLOCK IS JS (CLAUDE.md 3.2). The plugin knows how to
// turn the receiver up and how to give up on its own after maxMs; the pairing
// window, the confirmation interval, the movement threshold and the whole
// classification live here and stay tunable through a UAT roll.
//
// WHY ANY OF IT MATTERS. On the owner's 5:07pm drive home the app got SEVEN
// fixes in fourteen minutes: gaps of 15s, 146s, 282s, 119s, 15s and 167s.
// Straight lines between points that far apart cut every curve, so two legs on
// a 3.2 mile route measured 2.3 and 3.1; and one bad point in a sparse set has
// nothing to average it out, so the same drive logged 4.8.
let _geoDriveWinAt=0;        // ms the window was opened (0 = closed)
let _geoDriveWinWhy='';      // what opened it, for the journal
let _geoDriveWinAskedAt=0;   // last bridge call, so a stream of events is one ask

// How far apart the two halves of the correlation may be. Three minutes covers
// both orders with room: the coprocessor's own declaration lag is under a
// minute, and a fence exit lands one to two minutes behind the parking space.
// Short enough that a walk past a parked truck at 10:00 and a passenger ride
// at 10:30 can never pair with each other.
const _GEO_DRIVE_PAIR_MS=3*60000;
// The NATIVE cap. Deliberately generous against a real drive and still far

// to the server and stops there. The 12:04 fence exit then armed the fix
// half against nothing, and the truck drove to the next fence with the
// radio off and no card on the dashboard.
//
// The coprocessor's history is the same fact from the other side: if its
// latest transition is automotive, with no foot transition after it, the
// phone is in a moving truck RIGHT NOW, and "now" is the motion half. Runs
// at boot and on every return to the foreground. Bounded: a drive that
// started more than half an hour ago is the passenger-or-forgotten case the
// window cap already closes, not a reason to spend radio.
// THE TAPE IS THE PRIMARY DEPARTURE SIGNAL (owner 2026-09-03).
//
// CoreMotion gives the same fact through two doors. The LIVE stream
// (startActivityUpdates) reports "automotive" and is the only real-time
// source, but it waits for confidence: on the owner's own 16:08 departure it
// did not speak until 16:08:57. The HISTORY query (motionSince) reports the
// same flip as "driving" and already had it at 16:08:06, fifty-one seconds
// earlier and with the truer timestamp.
//
// The deriver already reads the history, so the LEG starts at the right
// instant either way. What the gap costs is the POSITION: the fix attached to
// the departure is taken most of a minute into the drive rather than at the
// curb, and that fix is what decides which fence was departed from.
//
// So the history is polled while the app is alive and no drive window is
// open, and whichever door reports first opens the window. The live flip
// remains the backup, unchanged, for every moment the JS is not running.
//

// what produced "geo_replace_day: 4 overlapping pair(s)" and a refused write.

// Making the ping blind fixed the phantom crossings. Making it ACCURATE fixes

// act on every half hour, not just at the fence edges.
//
// So the ping now buys one burst. The push-ping's own coordinates are still

// that fires mid-session, gets delivered live, AND is still sitting in that
// buffer at the NEXT reload (the version watchdog, a WKWebView memory-pressure
// kill, a park-mode wake) gets replayed a second time with its true capture
// timestamp. That alone is harmless IF live and replay agree on the leg's
// start/end clock, because _geoLegKey is deterministic on legStart, so a
// second close with an IDENTICAL legStart is caught for free by the existing
// exact-legKey idempotency guard (mileage.js autoLogDriveTrip). The bug was
// that they did NOT agree: this function used to stamp __tdTs only when
// `replay` was true, so a LIVE event clocked itself off Date.now() at
// whatever moment the JS handler actually got around to it (which lags the
// real GPS fix by however long the main thread was busy, an in-flight
// geocode, a _geoPingBusy drop-and-retry on the next ping), while its
// buffered twin, replayed later, clocked off the true ev.ts. Two derivations

// on site, then nothing for nine hours, then three at 16:17 as the truck drove
// off, 10,499ft away. The first rule walked forward, hit the 16:17 fix, and cut

// standing still at a job produces NO fixes at all. Silence is the signature of

// check was built for: fixes every few minutes, continuously, walking across
// four states. Those two shapes have to be read differently.

//     16:17 fixes on 08-19 are the departure, not a contradiction. This alone
//     is what makes a sparse tape safe.
//   * Every remaining fix off site means they were never here: the claim goes.
//     That is 08-24, and only 08-24.
//   * An off-site run touching the FIRST or LAST remaining fix moves that
//     anchor in to the nearest on-site fix. Evidence at an end can shorten
//     from that end.
//   * An off-site run strictly in the MIDDLE is a lunch or supply run they
//     came back from. One row cannot carry a hole, and the live 'stop' row
//     already covers that gap, so the claim stands untouched.

// to the same real place (a scheduled job's geofence row vs. a saved-place
// row for the same client). Both show up as extra rows for what was really
// one continuous visit. This pass merges both cases: same person, same

// both sides sit in the same Central day. Anything recorded in the gap
// BLOCKS the merge (the person demonstrably left), the exact inversion of
// the disaster mode where transient rows CHAINED a merge across a real
// lunch break. Reconciled rows are excluded from candidacy entirely: the
// 2026-08-23 corruption happened because a reconciled full-day guess
// resolved to the same client name as the live visits, overlapped both,

// billed nothing may really have been a man loading his truck, and refusing to
// ever add a minute would leave that unpaid forever. It is still never a
// guess: the load window comes off the tape exactly as a live close would have
// read it, and no walk on the tape means no row.
//
// The paperwork half cannot be recovered and is not attempted. App-active time
// was never recorded anywhere but in memory, so a visit that closed before

// another gps ping and if it's in a fence it completes the mileage and time

// this replaces the timing half of all of them.
//
// His 08-27 is the proof. CoreMotion said driving at 07:49:43; the shop fence

// a 7-minute drive was recorded as 3 and the missing head showed up in the log
// as a gap the app could not explain. Again at midday: driving at 12:01:35,
// fence exit at 12:04:33, and another 3 minutes went missing. Snapping to the
// tape closes both, and no gap can exist afterwards, because the segments
// tile the day by construction.

// swears happened and no row carries at all.
//
// It runs the same rules the live path runs, through the same helpers:
// _geoTapeSegments says when the wheels turned, and the FENCE half of the
// feature is the arrival-side row that already exists (the dwell the fence
// opened where this drive ended). The owner's own sign-off rule from 08/27
// is the gate: "needs a geo fence to say yes we're saving that drive." A tape
// drive with no arrival row is NOT written; it stays unaccounted, and the day
// rail asks the human, which is that feature's whole job.
//
// CREATES DRIVES ONLY. On-site time is what the rail asks about; drives are
// objective from the tape plus the arrival fence. And it creates nothing
// where ANY row already stands, soft-deleted included: a deleted row is a
// DECISION (a personal trip dropped, a truncated evening, an owner
// strike-through), not an absence, and resurrecting one would undo the very

// -> Shop example: the personal middle stop drops out, and only the direct
// Home Depot -> Shop leg survives. But nothing ever told the ALREADY-WRITTEN

// bad row already on the books predates it and stays exactly as wrong as it
// was. On the owner's account that is 541 minutes billed to one job on
// 2026-08-24 while the recorded fixes walk Topeka, Kansas City, Colorado, Salt
// Lake City.
//
// This is that same check as a sweep. Same helper (_geoPingTrim), same fence
// figure the live machine uses, run over every reconciled row in the window on
// every cleanup pass. A row whose own breadcrumbs contradict it is trimmed to
// what they support, or deleted when nothing is left.
//
// It also replaces the three-part scaffold that looked necessary an hour ago:
// re-key the trim's fragments to preserve legKey provenance, extend the drive
// sweep to on-site rows, then a one-time pass to clear the backlog. None of
// that is needed. Provenance only mattered for tracing a row back to a mileage
// leg that might have been swept; the pings are ground truth directly, so the
// legKey is irrelevant and a fragment with no legKey at all (which is exactly
// what the 08-24 rows are) is checked the same as any other row. No one-time
// script, no hardcoded dates, and it keeps working on days nobody has seen yet.
//
// SCOPE: '-reconciled' sources only. A live 'geofence'/'place'/'stop' row is
