// ── Live Activities: the lock screen and the Dynamic Island (owner 2026-08-17) ─
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES: the app already knows two things worth showing all
// day, a running job clock and an active drive, and for most of a contractor's
// day it can show neither, because the phone is in a pocket or a truck mount
// with the app closed. A Live Activity puts that state on the lock screen and in
// the Dynamic Island, where they are already looking, at a cost of zero taps.
//
// EVERY DECISION IS HERE (CLAUDE.md 3.2). The native plugin takes finished
// strings and lays them out; it decides nothing. What counts as driving, what
// the card says, which color it wears, when it appears and disappears: all of it
// is below, so it stays tunable through a UAT roll instead of a 15-minute macOS
// build and a forced TestFlight update on every tester's phone.
//
// Two channels, because both can be true at once (driving to the next job while
// still clocked into the last one):
//   'drive' → miles and a live readout while the truck is moving
//   'clock' → the job timer, ticking on-device
//
// The ONE thing native owns is the ticking clock. iOS renders it from a start
// timestamp with the app closed and no updates spent; sending a fresh string
// every second would drain the battery and blow ActivityKit's update budget in
// minutes. So a timer card is started ONCE and never updated on a tick.

// What the two cards look like. Colors match the app's own meaning: the denim
// blue the drive banner already uses, the green the clock already uses.
// LOCK SCREEN colors, not the app's. #2D5DA8 and #0E6B39 are the brand navy
// and forest green, and they are right inside the app, where they sit on cream
// and white. On the lock screen they sit on a Material blur over whatever
// wallpaper the person has, and the owner's own card (2026-08-24, over a dark
// green wallpaper) read as almost black on black next to the Southwest Wallet
// pass right above it: "so dark and hard to read on our end, can we brighten
// the blue to match the southwest Apple wallet cards."
//
// The blue is not a guess: #0085E7 is the dominant accent sampled straight out
// of the Southwest pass in the owner's own screenshot, which is the comparison
// he made. Against a dark card it measures 4.46:1 where the brand navy managed
// 2.63:1, so it clears AA for the bold numbers the card actually renders (3:1)
// where the old one did not. The green is its counterpart, picked to sit at a
// similar weight beside it rather than to match anything of Southwest's.
//
// The widget already carries a dark shadow behind every tinted glyph for the
// light-wallpaper case (TdLiveWidget.swift, DualReadout's note), so brightening
// only ever helps the dark one and the light case is unchanged.

// ── The foreground is the only place a card can be BORN ──────────────────────
// ActivityKit refuses Activity.request() from a backgrounded app ("Target is
// not foreground"). Updates are fine from anywhere, so a card that is already
// up keeps ticking with the phone in a pocket; it is only the start that has
// to happen on screen.
//
// Everything that wants a card is driven by the geo engine, which by design
// runs while the app is backgrounded, so without this every on-site card was
// requested at exactly the moment iOS would not grant it. The owner watched a
// drive card flash up for one second on 2026-09-03 (it started only because
// the app happened to be open) and never once saw an on-site card all day.
//
// So on every return to the foreground: replay anything iOS refused, then
// re-assert the live state, which is idempotent because _liveActSet dedups on
// a signature and an unchanged card costs nothing.
