// ── Sizing estimate: the HVAC load module ────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS CAREFULLY NOT.
//
// This produces a SIZING ESTIMATE: heating and cooling in BTU/h and a nominal
// equipment size range, derived from measured geometry and a set of stated
// assumptions. It is a planning number for a proposal conversation. It is NOT
// a permit document, it is NOT a certified load calculation, and nothing in
// this file, in the UI it feeds, or in the proposal it prints on may say or
// imply otherwise. `LOADCALC_NOT_FOR_PERMIT` is the first warning on every
// result, including the refusals, and there is no input, flag, or option
// anywhere in this module that removes it. That is deliberate: the moment a
// contractor can turn the disclaimer off is the moment we are the ones who
// sized somebody's equipment.
//
// The industry's standard residential procedure is published under a
// registered trademark and its approved software is licensed by name. We do
// not hold that license, so we do not use that name, do not claim conformance
// with it, and do not imply permit acceptability. Heat-transfer arithmetic
// itself is a method, not an expression, and 17 USC 102(b) puts methods
// outside copyright entirely (same reasoning as codes/README.md). So the
// physics below is ours to implement. The name is not ours to use. Keep that
// line exactly where it is.
//
// THE RULES, inherited from js/code-engine.js because they were right there:
//
// 1. PURE. `loadcalcEstimate(input)` is same-inputs-same-output forever: no
//    clock, no network, no globals, no reads of S. js/geo-derive.js earned
//    this rule the hard way and it is what makes the vectors at the bottom of
//    tests/e2e-loadcalc.spec.js mean anything. The only impure thing here is
//    `loadcalcFromScan`, which looks a scan up and then hands a plain object
//    to the pure function. That boundary is the whole design.
//
// 2. NOTHING UNVERIFIED IS PRESENTED AS FACT. An LLM will produce an R-value
//    that looks right and is not. Every assembly number in `LOADCALC_ENVELOPES`
//    is currently a PLACEHOLDER: it carries `ph:true`, names the public source
//    a human must type it out of, and prints into `assumed` with the word
//    PLACEHOLDER in it. `LOADCALC_SOURCES` is the map of where each one has to
//    come from and whether that source is even redistributable. Flipping a
//    value to verified is a human act by somebody holding the document.
//
// 3. NEVER AUTO-FILL SILENTLY (owner rule, code-engine.js). Every value this
//    module chose rather than received is in `assumed`, in plain words, and it
//    prints. A default he never saw is the failure mode with our name on it.
//
// WHY THIS DOES NOT RIDE `codeEval`. It is the same result shape on purpose,
// and callers can treat the two identically. But codeEval keys on
// family+edition and gates on a verified code dataset, and a sizing estimate
// has no edition and is not a code rule: there is no book to be on the 2023
// printing of. Forcing it through that door would have meant inventing a fake
// family, which is worse than mirroring 25 lines of a result constructor.
//
// DESIGN TEMPERATURES ARE NOT SHIPPED, AND THAT IS A LICENSING ANSWER, NOT AN
// OVERSIGHT. See `LOADCALC_SOURCES['ashrae-169']`. The 99%/1% design
// conditions everyone in the trade quotes are published tables that are
// licensed for software use for a fee; we do not hold that license, so we do
// not ship them. The lookup below therefore returns ok:false until a dataset
// is registered, and `loadcalcEstimate` refuses rather than guessing at the
// one input the whole answer scales linearly with. A contractor who types his
// own design temperatures in gets a real answer immediately.

// The line that never comes off. Every result carries it, first, always.
