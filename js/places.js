// js/places.js: contractor-owned geocoded locations, and the stop/drive logic
// that needs them.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The geofence machine knew two kinds of place: the shop
// (S.officeLat/officeLon) and job sites (client addresses). Supply houses were
// invisible, which broke drive tracking three ways:
//
//   1. Time PARKED at a supply house counted as driving. Nothing contained the
//      truck, so the drive clock ran while it sat in the lot and those minutes
//      landed on the next job's leg.
//   2. A supply run that came back to the shop logged NOTHING. Leaving the shop
//      started the clock; arriving back merely cleared it, because a drive entry
//      was only ever written on arriving at a JOB. A real deductible round trip
//      produced zero miles.
//   3. Every leg billed to its destination job, so shop -> supply -> job charged
//      that job for the supply stop too.
//
// Mileage is a deduction, so those are accuracy defects, not cosmetics.
//
// HOW PLACES GET CREATED. Two ways, neither of which is a setup chore:
//
//   • From an expense. When a receipt is logged the phone is standing in the
//     lot, so the expense already carries lat/lon (js/geo-track.js _stampGeo)
//     and a vendor name. That is a named, business-purposed location for free,
//     and it is the strongest kind: IRS Pub 463 wants destination AND business
//     purpose for a deductible trip, and the receipt supplies both.
//   • From repetition. A stop that keeps happening at the same coordinates is
//     obviously somewhere that matters, so after PLACE_REPEAT_MIN visits it is
//     offered rather than assumed.
//
// THE COMMUTE GUARD. Commuting miles are NOT deductible, and home-to-first-job
// is the single most common mileage adjustment in an audit. Home is also, to a
// dwell detector, the most obvious "place" there is: the truck sits there all
// night, every night. Left alone this engine would offer someone their own house
// as a supply house within three days, and accepting it would start logging
// commute miles as business trips. So two rules, both enforced in
// _placeIsLikelyHome:
//
//   1. Any dwell over PLACE_HOME_DWELL_MS (6h) is somewhere you sleep, not
//      somewhere you buy conduit.
//   2. The coordinate the working day STARTED at is where you left from, which
//      for the overwhelming majority of contractors is home.
//
// A contractor with a qualifying home office can mark it themselves (kind:
// 'home_office'), which genuinely changes the tax answer. That is a decision for
// them and their CPA, never something inferred from GPS.

const PLACE_DWELL_MS      = 5*60*1000; // a stop, not a traffic light
const PLACE_MATCH_FT      = 600;       // same fence radius the job machine uses
const PLACE_REPEAT_MIN    = 3;         // visits before an unknown stop is offered
const PLACE_MAX_ACC_M     = 150;       // looser than this and the fix is meaningless
const PLACE_HOME_DWELL_MS = 6*60*60*1000; // sleep, not a supply run
// The kinds a PLACE can genuinely be: a fixed point in the day that belongs
// to NO ONE client (owner 2026-08-06). A Place record carries no client_id,
// so anything inherently tied to one specific customer, a job site, a client
// consult, a payment pickup, belongs to that client's own record (the job/
// estimate scheduling system, which already auto-fences it) rather than a
// generic named location that can never actually link back to who it's for.
// Job sites in particular already fence automatically off the real jobs
// array; a job_site PLACE would have been a second, disconnected way to
// describe the same thing.
//
// 'home_office' and 'shop' mean exactly what they mean elsewhere in this
// file: 'home_office' is the one value _geoAtHomeOffice checks for the
// commute-deduction rule, and 'shop' is what _migrateShopToPlaces guards
// against duplicating.
//
// This is deliberately a SUBSET of MILE_PURPOSES (js/constants.js), not a
// mirror of it: the trip-purpose picker on a manually-logged mileage row
// still offers the full vocabulary (Job site, Client Consult, Payment
// Collection, Estimate included), those stay valid ways to categorize a
// trip by hand. Only the automatic PLACE side is scoped down to what a
// place, not a client, can actually be.
