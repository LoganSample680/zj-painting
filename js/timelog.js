// ── Time Log, chronological "where did my time go" view ───────────────────
// Merges two time-tracking sources that don't otherwise talk to each other:
//   1. timeEntries (local array / td_time_entries cloud table), manual
//      Clock in/out, tagged with logged_by_uid/logged_by_name at save time
//      (js/jobs.js clockOut()).
//   2. job_time_entries (Supabase, via _fetchCrewLabor), GPS arrival/
//      departure auto-tracking (js/geo-track.js), already carries
//      employee_user_id.
// Owner call 2026-08-20: this is now ALSO the unified crew hours report
// (absorbing what was going to be a separate Crew Cost redesign, owner: "I
// don't want this under crew cost, want it under time log"), hours only,
// never dollars ("don't need pay rate here just time"). A year selector,
// then month accordions, January (oldest) THROUGH December (newest), the
// opposite order from every other Books accordion (Income/Expenses read
// newest-first) because this is a "how did the year build up" report, not
// a "what happened lately" ledger. Each month opens into week accordions
// (_bkWeekAcc, js/finance.js), and each week has its own Week/S/M/T/W/T/F/S
// day picker (owner: "need the day picker to change what day we're looking
// at") that swaps the SAME row list between the whole week and one day,
// nothing ever shown twice.
//
// Anyone with payroll/team permission (_canViewComp, owner or a manager)
// gets a Me/Team toggle at the top: Team breaks hours out per employee
// (avatar, on-site/drive/supply split bar, OT flag, your own row tagged
// "(you)"); Me is the same plain "your own days" view everyone else gets,
// plus a Share button. Everyone defaults to Me, owner included (reversed
// 2026-08-23; owners used to land on Team by default). Either way,
// whatever the picker currently shows (a week or one
// day) also opens into the exact same entries table this page always had,
// Edit/Delete on manual rows, the only place an entry can still be fixed.
// $ cost lives entirely in Crew Cost (js/finance.js _crewCostRender), which
// reads the same underlying rows; this page never touches wage/loaded rates.

  // the match on every auto/reconciled row and blanks the address (owner report
  // 2026-08-21: "if at a job it says the address but still"). Same coercion the
  // rest of the app already uses at the Supabase boundary, js/geo-track.js:1042,

  // key through here, so one bad element silently aborted an entire merge
  // sweep and made it look like a day with nothing to merge (CI shard 6,
  // three separate zero-merge failures, 2026-08-24, found only once that
  // sweep stopped swallowing its own throw). These arrays are globals that

// "unaccounted for time doesn't count to the total unless it's added."
//
// The not-counting half needs no code: an unaccounted row is unpaid, and
// every total on this page already skips unpaid (_tlEmpWeekAgg,
// _tlComputeWeeklyRunning, _tlComputeOT, the day subtotal). So a hole is
// visible and free by construction, which is the honest default: the app
// never bills a stretch it cannot account for.
//
// This is the other half. The contractor is the only one who knows what those
// 104 minutes were, and once he says, it becomes real time like any other
// manual entry. It writes a MANUAL row through the same array and the same
// save path clocking out uses (§7.3), never a new kind of record: it must
// edit, delete, sync and pay exactly like time he keyed in himself, because
// that is what it is.
// Does a break of this length get paid? (owner 2026-08-29: "Break would need
// a toggle if they get paid on it or not right?" Yes, and the honest default
// is not a coin flip.)
//
// The federal rule is shaped by DURATION, not by what anyone calls it: short
// rest breaks (29 CFR 785.18, roughly 5 to 20 minutes) are compensable and
// count toward the workweek, while a bona fide meal period (785.19, 30
// minutes or more with the employee fully relieved of duty) need not be.
// So 'auto' reads the length and applies that shape. A contractor whose
// state or handbook says otherwise sets S.breakPaid to 'paid' or 'unpaid'
// and the length stops mattering.
//

// "I like the day rail but what would a compliant day rail look like for ADA
// compliance?" ... "Why can't the lines be one big line and unaccounted for
// times being grey."
//
// One continuous spine down the day. Every row's spine segment spans that
// row's FULL height with no margin between rows, so adjacent segments touch
// and read as a single unbroken line whose colour changes at each boundary.
// That is only honest because the rows already tile the day: the clock-is-the
// -tape model closes every segment at the next transition and _tlFillUnaccounted
// covers whatever is left, so a visible break in the line would be a bug, not
// a gap in the work.
//
// ACCESSIBILITY, the part that shaped the markup rather than decorating it:
//  - 1.4.1 colour is never the only carrier. Every segment prints an icon AND
//    a word ("Drive time", "Break"), so the spine colour is reinforcement.
//  - 1.4.3 / 1.4.11 measured against --bg #FFFFFF: ink 18.15:1, --text3 5.43:1,
//    --blue 6.48:1, teal 6.59:1, amber 6.62:1, load 8.37:1. Text clears 4.5:1
//    and the spine clears the 3:1 non-text minimum.
//  - 1.4.4 / 1.4.10 the grid is minmax(0,...) tracks, never fixed px, so it
//    reflows to 320px and survives 200% zoom instead of clipping. An earlier
//    attempt used an `em` media query as the resize lever; `em` in a media
//    query resolves against the browser's INITIAL font size, not a root we
//    set, so that lever never fired at all. Tracks do.
//  - 2.5.8 every chip and button is at least 24px tall (32 here).
//  - The list is a real <ol> so a screen reader announces position in the day.

// ── The week bars: how much, and does anything look wrong ──────────────────
// Owner, 2026-08-30, on the timeline version that came first: "that's gotta be
// the ugliest thing I've ever saw, how do other time log apps do these views?"
//
// The research answer was that nobody draws a week as a timeline, and it is not
// an oversight. Two patterns own the category. Jobber, Housecall Pro and
// ServiceTitan render a payroll GRID (days down, people across, hours in the
// cell), which is built for a clerk at a desk. Harvest, Toggl and Clockify put
// ONE BIG NUMBER over SEVEN DAILY TOTALS, which is the same shape as Screen
// Time and Health and reads in a glance on a phone.
//
// A timeline answers "when exactly." Standing at the truck the question is
// "how much, and which day looks wrong," and only then "show me that day."
// So: seven bars for the shape, tap one for the day rail. The owner's own
// words for the model, and they are the spec:
//
//   "seeing how the day of that week looked at a glance with the bar and how
//    time was spent to see if something is wrong then clicking into it gives
//    you the full daily rail breakdown we already created"
//
// Three things carry "something is wrong," and each is readable without hue:
//   - the 8-hour guide line, so a long day is over a line and not merely taller
//     than its neighbour (a bar scaled only to its own week makes every week
//     look normal, which is the failure mode of every "scale to max" chart)
//   - the amber ? on a day with an unanswered hole
//   - the OT flag when the week itself crosses 40
// The bar label, split across TWO LINES instead of squeezed onto one.
//
// This went through "11h 54m" (overran its neighbour at 320px), then "11h54m"
// (still touched it), then "11h54" (fit, but the owner's answer was "don't
// want hours cutting off"). He is right, and the earlier versions were all the
// same mistake: making the number smaller to fit a box, when the box was the
// thing that should have changed. A seven-column grid gives each day about
// 35px across and as much vertical room as we care to use, so the hours go
// above the minutes and nothing is abbreviated at all.
//
// The text is not decoration. It is what keeps the height comparison readable
// to someone who cannot judge a height (1.4.1), so shrinking or truncating it
// was never actually on the table.
function _tlBarAmtParts(min){
  // Math.max(0, NaN) is NaN, not 0, so a garbage minutes value printed "NaNm"

// ── Making a bar look like something you can open ──────────────────────────
// Owner, 2026-08-30: "how do we make the bars scream click me for more info
// without saying that? What's the psychological design aspect that makes
// somebody click the bar wondering what it will do?"
//
// Two different jobs, and they need two different answers.
//
// LOOKING tappable is perceived affordance. A flat painted rectangle reads as
// a PICTURE, and nobody taps a picture. The same rectangle with a lit top edge
// and a shadow under it reads as an OBJECT sitting on the baseline, and an
// object invites a hand. That is all in the CSS and costs no space, which is
// why it is the first thing to reach for.
//
// WANTING to tap is a different thing: curiosity is not "there might be more
// here", it is a SPECIFIC COUNTABLE UNKNOWN (Loewenstein's information gap).
// "9h 54m" is a closed fact with nothing missing. "9h 54m, and 8 stops" is an
// open one: you now know exactly how many things are inside and not what they
// are. That is the itch, and it is information worth having anyway, which is
// what separates it from bait.
//
// It goes INSIDE the bar rather than under it. A fourth line of type under a
// 46px column is the clutter the owner has cut three times today, and a number
// printed on the thing it counts reads as a property of that thing.
//
// Deliberately NOT done: a "tap for details" label. An explicit instruction is
// what you write when the affordance failed, which is exactly why he asked for
// this without saying it.
function _tlStopCount(rows){
  // Places you actually stopped. A drive is not a stop, an unanswered hole is
  // not a stop, and neither is a wheels-turning leg between two of them.
  // A hole in the array is not a stop either. _tlRailKind(null) answers 'job'
  // (its callers want a safe default, not a crash), so counting its answer
  // without checking the row first turned two empty slots into "2 stops": a

// up disagreeing about what a minute was.

// shimmer at all, they just load in, only want skeleton shimmer one time."
//
// Two faults, one sentence. The placeholder was four generic grey LINES, so
// what it promised (a list) was not what arrived (a chart), and the swap read
// as a change of subject rather than a load. And it reprinted on every render,
// which is every drill tap: by then the rows are already in memory, so the
// shimmer was measuring nothing and just flashing. It is a first-load thing
// now, once per session. After that the bars growing out of the baseline ARE
// the load, which is what he means by "they just load in".
//
// The heights are fixed and deliberately uneven. A row of equal bars reads as
// a real chart of a boring week and you wait to see it change; an uneven one
// reads as a placeholder. It is not random either, because a placeholder that
// differs every time it is drawn is noise.

// _tlWeekMineHtml, _tlWeekCache, _tlPickerSel, setTimeLogDayPick and

// world: a chip row to pick a day, a per-week render cache so one accordion
// could redraw without touching the others, and a body that stitched them
// together.
//
// The drill (2026-08-30) replaced every one of those jobs. There is one level
// on screen, so there is nothing to redraw selectively and no cache to keep;
// a day is reached by tapping its bar, so there are no chips; and the level's
// body is built straight in renderTimeLog. Left in place they would have been
// ~150 lines nothing calls, which is exactly what §7 forbids.
//
// _tlWeekOwnerHtml went with them: its only caller was the week body. Team's
// per-person cards come from _tlEmpAccHtml, which is untouched.
// Me/Team display toggle, for anyone with payroll/team permission. Owners
// default to Team, managers default to Me (see renderTimeLog); either can
// switch any time and the choice sticks for the rest of the session, same
// as _tlYear. A permission loss (e.g. a dual-hat switch to a crew hat with
