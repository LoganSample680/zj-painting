//   PARKED  : GPS fully off. CoreLocation region monitoring (geofence hardware)
//             plus significant-location-change watch for departure. Near-zero
//             battery, no blue arrow pinned in the Dynamic Island.
//   BURST   : a few seconds of kCLLocationAccuracyBest on demand, then dark
//             again. What stamps a boundary at the kerb instead of half a mile
//             down the road (burstFix).
//   DRIVE   : the window (setSampling, owner 2026-09-01). Best accuracy at a
//             30m filter, opened by JS when the motion coprocessor flips to
//             automotive or a relaunched app sees a fence exit, closed when
//             the leg closes, and capped in Swift so it can never outlive the
//             drive it was opened for. This is the only state that produces a
//             breadcrumb dense enough to draw a route from.
//
// Between all three the radio is OFF by default. Nothing here holds a standing
// location session any more: the heartbeat's keepalive is opt-in and JS leaves
// it off (see heartbeatKeepalive), which is what takes the blue arrow down
// between drives.
//
// Every native event is appended to a UserDefaults buffer BEFORE being emitted
// as a listener event, so fixes that arrive while the WebView is suspended or
// dead replay into the fence machine on the next boot via drainBuffer().

    // Yes, and until now nothing here could answer it. The JS layer inferred a
    // web-shaped granted/denied/prompt from whether the watcher was delivering,
    // which collapses the single distinction this app lives or dies on:
    //
    //   whenInUse : works only while the app is on screen. No background pings,
    //               no region wakes, no drive logged from a pocket. Reads as
    //               "granted" everywhere and silently tracks nothing.
    //   always    : the only state where this product does its job.
    //
    // ACCURACY IS THE SECOND AXIS, and it is just as fatal. Since iOS 14 a user
    // can grant Always and still switch Precise Location off, which downgrades
    // fixes to reducedAccuracy: kilometres, against fences measured in hundreds
    // of feet. Geofencing is simply dead in that state with nothing anywhere
    // saying why, so it is reported alongside rather than buried.
    //
    // DEVICE-WIDE LOCATION SERVICES IS THE THIRD AXIS, and it is reported now.
    // An earlier note here claimed the only API for it was "deprecated in iOS
    // 17". That was wrong, and the correction matters because the nuance it
    // waved away is the exact silent failure this app keeps hitting:
    //
    //   CLLocationManager.locationServicesEnabled() is NOT deprecated. What
    //   Apple added (Xcode 14.1 onward) is a runtime warning when it is called
    //   ON THE MAIN THREAD, because it is a synchronous cross-process lookup
    //   that blocks the caller and has been seen to hang outright. The fix for
    //   the warning is to move the call off the main thread, which is what the
    //   dispatch below does, not to stop asking the question.
    //
    // Why the question has to be asked at all: the per-app grant and the global
    // switch are INDEPENDENT. Turning off Settings > Privacy & Security >
    // Location Services leaves authorizationStatus reporting .authorizedAlways
    // untouched, so without this the app reports "always" to the server while
    // not a single fix will ever arrive, which is precisely the shape of a live
    // account showing always and zero pings. Waiting for a .denied delegate
    // error instead is inference, and inference is what put the wrong answer in
    // the database in the first place.
    //
    // What iOS 18 added, and why it is not used here: CLServiceSession exposes
    // a diagnostics async sequence carrying authorizationDeniedGlobally ("the
    // session will be suspended while the user has disabled Location Services
    // system-wide") plus fullAccuracyDenied, alwaysAuthorizationDenied,
    // insufficientlyInUse and serviceSessionRequired. It is push-based, so no
    // blocking, and it is strictly richer. Two reasons it is not the answer
    // today: it is iOS 18 and up while this ships at a 15.0 deployment target,
    // and constructing a session takes an authorization requirement, so on a
    // notDetermined device a plain status query would raise a permission
    // prompt. The call below answers the same question on every version we
    // ship to, with no prompt and no side effect.
