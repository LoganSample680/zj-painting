"""
Read-only TestFlight status against the App Store Connect API.

Answers the question the CI board cannot: a green `ios-beta` run proves the
IPA left the runner, NOT that Apple accepted it or that a tester can install
it. Those are different facts and only Apple holds the second one. This is
what let a tester sit on build 35 for days while every workflow run since
reported success.

Every request here is a GET. Nothing in this file creates, modifies, expires
or distributes anything, and it must stay that way: the .p8 it authenticates
with can upload builds and edit the store listing, so the blast radius of a
mistake is the live app, not a test account.
