-- Timesheets (owner 2026-09-05): "Submit and send."
--
-- The week chart's Send button used to share a text and lock nothing. Now
-- it opens a review of the week, the person SUBMITS it, and the text that
-- goes out carries a stamp (who, when) and a link. The link opens
-- timesheet.html: the same bars and the same day rail, read only, with
-- Approve and Reject for whoever runs the crew, app or no app, login or no
-- login. Submitted days refuse every rebuild (geo_replace_day revision 7,
-- below). The person can still fix a day by hand and submit again: a new
-- version at the same link, marked corrected. Rejected reopens the week.
--
-- One row per person per week. The token is the whole secret of the public
-- page: two random uuids, 256 bits, unguessable, never listed anywhere anon
-- can read. Core gen_random_uuid(), not pgcrypto: on the hosted project the
-- extension lives in the `extensions` schema and is not on the search path
-- when a table default is compiled (deploy run 80, 2026-09-05).
