// A deliberately FAKE verified code dataset, for tests only.
//
// Why this exists: every real dataset under codes/ ships verified:false with
// every value null, and codeEval refuses to return anything from one. That is
// correct and it is not negotiable (codes/README.md). But it also means nothing
// downstream of the engine can be tested until somebody buys a book and types
// three hundred numbers in, and "we will test the wiring later" is how wiring
// ships broken.
//
// So: a dataset with the right SHAPE and knowingly wrong NUMBERS. Every value
// here is a round number chosen to be obviously invented, and the edition is
// named 'FAKE' so it can never be mistaken for a real one, never collide with a
// real edition key, and never be selected by a contractor: the settings picker
// lists whatever is registered, and a row reading "FAKE" is its own alarm.
//
// RULES FOR THIS FILE
//   1. It is never loaded by index.html and never fetched by the app. Tests
//      register it by hand.
//   2. No number in it may be plausible. If a value here ever looks like it
//      came out of a code book, it is wrong on purpose and should be made
//      rounder, not more realistic.
//   3. It proves wiring, never arithmetic. A test that asserts a load
//      calculation is CORRECT belongs against the published worked examples,
//      not against this.
