// REAL flow: a home office is two kinds of work, and the log says which.
//
// Owner rule (2026-08-29): "home office should call the last motion event from
// start time to end time before a drive, that's truck loading time... then
// home office counts app open time while in home office geofence, that means
// work is actively being done so it needs counted as its own thing."
//
// This drives the same handler iOS drives, _geoOnPing(position), against the
// REAL Dev Supabase, with a real saved place of kind home_office, and then
// asserts the rows that actually landed in job_time_entries and the words that
// actually rendered on the Time Log. The motion tape is the one thing a
// headless runner cannot produce, so the plugin accessor is stubbed to return
// a tape: everything downstream of it, _geoMotionTape through _geoHomeTape,
// _geoHomeLoadWindow, _geoHomeSplit and the closer, is the shipping code.
//
// What each step pins down, and why it is here rather than in the offline
// shard: the offline spec proves the classifier in isolation, this proves the
// rows survive the queue, the drain, RLS and the renderer, which is the half
// that has broken before.
//
// Leaves its seed data in the account on purpose (CLAUDE.md §12.7).

// yesterday's home_office place is still sitting at these coordinates when it
// runs again, and placeAt() resolves the fence to whichever place it finds
// there first. The run that followed therefore entered the PREVIOUS run's
// fence and wrote rows keyed to the previous run's place id, so the assertion
// looked for its own id and found nothing at all. The rows were correct; the

// sweep correctly soft-deletes one about a second after it lands. Every
// deletion observed on 2026-08-29 is accounted for by that rule and none of
