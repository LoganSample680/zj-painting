// @ts-check
// ── The owner's own Tuesday, end to end, on real Topeka addresses ────────────
//
// Owner script (2026-08-01), verbatim:
//   set 2015 SW Randolph Ave, Topeka KS 66604 [home office]
//   → 309 S Kansas Ave, Topeka KS            [client, work]
//   → the Home Depot in Topeka               [supplies]
//   → God knows where for lunch              [THIS SHOULDN'T COUNT]
//   → back to 309 S Kansas Ave               [more work]
//   → 3125 SW 17th St, Topeka KS 66604       [estimate]
//   → home to 2015 SW Randolph Ave           [finish the day]
//
// And what it has to prove:
//   1. The mileage comes from Apple Maps, correctly, on every leg.
//   2. The time between stops calculates correctly.
//   3. Home Depot comes back BY NAME and lands as a supply place.
//
// WHY THE ADDRESSES ARE GEOCODED AT RUNTIME rather than pinned as constants:
// pinning coordinates would test the machine against numbers I chose, and the
// thing under test is precisely whether the app resolves a real address to the
// right point and asks Apple for the distance between two of them. A constant
// would quietly skip the half that can actually be wrong.
//
// WHERE THIS CAN RUN. MapKit's token is domain-locked to tradedeskpro.app and
// *.pages.dev (js/mileage.js), so on localhost _routeDistance silently falls
// back to Valhalla/OSRM. Those are real road distances, so the leg structure
// and the time maths are fully checked on the local runner, but the assertion
// that the number came from APPLE only means anything on a preview URL. The
// test states which engine answered rather than pretending it does not matter.
